# Fraudulent-Movement-Detection
The proposed system provides an effective solution for detecting fraudulent human movements and maintaining discipline in various environments. The system can be applied to various settings, such as examination halls, security cabins, and offices, to prevent violations of established rules and regulations and improve security. Furthermore, the system's open-source nature makes it accessible to a broader audience and encourages further research in the field of fraudulent human movement detection

**Methodology**

•	Data collection: The first step involves collecting video data from the cameras installed in the examination halls or security cabins. The data is collected in real-time and saved in a specific format that can be used for analysis.

•	Pre-processing: The collected data needs to be pre-processed to remove any noise or unwanted information. The pre-processing step may include resizing, normalization, and filtering of the data.

•	Object detection and tracking: The next step involves detecting and tracking the objects in the video data. This can be done using computer vision techniques such as background subtraction, optical flow, or feature detection.

•	Feature extraction: After object detection and tracking, features are extracted from the objects. These features may include shape, color, texture, or motion information.

•	Fraudulent movement detection: Machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) can be used to classify the extracted features as normal or fraudulent movements.

•	Alert generation: Once fraudulent movement is detected, an alert is generated, and appropriate action is taken to maintain discipline in the setting.

•	The proposed methodology can enhance the safety and security of individuals in various settings, including examination halls and security cabins.
